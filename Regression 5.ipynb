    "Elastic Net Regression is basically the combination of Ridge Regression and lasso Regression. It is a regularized regression technique that is used to deal with the problems of multicollinearity and overfitting. Elastic Net Regression is used for the case , when there are many independent featurers exist in data set.It diffrense from the liner regressions as it has a wide area of features....ie..overfitting reduction and feature slecetion. It commanly used for high daimentional data."
